## Problem 2

Import and tidy data

This spaghetti plot shows observations on each subject in the control
and the experimental group over time. This plot shows that the
experimental group’s observed values increased as the study progressed
from week 1 to week 8, showing a positive association between observed
value and time. The control group’s observed values range do not show
this trend. The control group’s observed values on week 8 are all lower
than the experimental group’s observed values on the same week.

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
