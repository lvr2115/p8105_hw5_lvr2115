Problem 2
This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

raw_data = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files("./data"),
    path = str_c("./data/", files)
  ) |>
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) |>
  unnest(data) 

tidy_data =
  raw_data |> 
   janitor::clean_names() |> 
   separate(files, sep="_", into = c("study_arm", "subject_id")) |>
   separate(subject_id, sep=".csv", into=c("subject_id")) |>
   pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("week"),
    names_prefix = "week_",
    names_to = "week_num",
    values_to = "obs"
  ) |>
  mutate(
     week_num = as.numeric(week_num)) |>
  select(study_arm, subject_id, week_num, obs)
```

```{r plot}

```


Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.
